Project Overview:
Project Name: Almost a circle
Language: Python
Topics Covered: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Exception handling, Serialization/Deserialization, JSON handling, File I/O, Unit Testing.
Main Tasks:
Unit Testing and PEP 8 Validation: Ensure all classes and methods are unit tested and comply with PEP 8 standards.
Base Class: Create a base class that manages the id attribute for future classes. Implement constructors to manage id attribute.
First Rectangle: Implement a Rectangle class that inherits from the Base class. Implement private instance attributes, getters, setters, and constructor.
Validate Attributes: Add validation to setter methods and instantiation.
Area Calculation: Implement a method to calculate the area of the Rectangle.
Display: Implement a method to display the Rectangle using the '#' character.
str Method: Override the str method to provide a string representation of the Rectangle.
Update Method: Implement methods to update attributes using positional and keyword arguments.
Square Class: Implement a Square class that inherits from Rectangle with additional validation.
Square Size: Implement getter and setter for size attribute in Square class.
Square Update: Implement update method for Square class.
Rectangle to Dictionary: Implement method to convert Rectangle instance to dictionary.
Square to Dictionary: Implement method to convert Square instance to dictionary.
Dictionary to JSON String: Implement method to convert list of dictionaries to JSON string.
JSON String to File: Implement method to save JSON string to a file.
JSON String to Dictionary: Implement method to convert JSON string to list of dictionaries.
Dictionary to Instance: Implement method to create an instance from a dictionary.
File to Instances: Implement method to load instances from a file.
File Organization:
Python scripts are organized into modules and classes adhering to PEP 8 standards.
Unit tests are written using the unittest module and organized in a separate 'tests' directory.
Development Environment:
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
Scripts are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
Repository Information:
The project is part of the alx-higher_level_programming repository.
Each task has its own file under the '0x0C-python-almost_a_circle' directory.
This project serves as a comprehensive exercise in Python programming, covering a wide range of topics and practices commonly used in real-world software development.
